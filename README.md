# Clipboard-landing-page

This website design was inspired from photos by frontendmentor.io. This was actually my second website that I ever done and I can say that I am happy with how it turned out. To create this page, only HTML and CSS were used, but I had a lot to learn about how the content of the HTML file should be structured so that it is easy to reach the final design.
At the same time, the page is fully responsive, adapted for both mobile and desktop devices.
